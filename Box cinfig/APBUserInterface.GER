SystemMailWelcomeMailBody=So you made it here in one piece. Good job. How long you can stay in one piece - that's another matter altogether. Let me give you a few friendly words of advice to help you get started.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\nThe Tutorial District is where you go to learn about the game. This district contains only new recruits, so you should be pretty safe.\nWe recommend getting the feel of the place first, so to start with follow the Parking (P) sign towards the garage nearby and use the ticket machine to spawn your vehicle.  Take a tour to get the feel of driving and see some sights.  \n\nWhen you are ready to start, press Ready, ([K] by default), and you will be assigned a mission after a short delay.  The first couple will be milk runs to get you used to the system, then we will throw you up against some other new players to get your feet wet.  Completing these missions will give you standing with the contact you do them for, which is one way to get new gear and outfits.\n\nGood luck out there.
